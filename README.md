# Skitter

An experimental bytecode interpreter for the Rust programming language. Not fit for any kind of serious use.

Currently uses rustc as a front-end, and supports a decent subset of the language.

Requires a specific rust compiler and components specified in `rust-toolchain.md` which cargo should install automatically.
