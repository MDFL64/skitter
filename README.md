# Skitter

An experimental bytecode interpreter for the Rust programming language. Not fit for any kind of serious use.

Currently uses rustc as a front-end, and supports a decent subset of the language. 

Requires the `rustc-dev` and `rust-src` components. Developed and tested on: `rustc 1.71.0-nightly (a77c55248 2023-05-06)`
