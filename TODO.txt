Interior mutability check needs to detect UnsafeCell.

Const promotion must ignore block statements!

Const promotion needs to support unsized types!

```
fn f() -> &'static [i32] {
    &[10,20,30]
}
```

Probably trait objects as well?

------------

Rustc evaluates {expression} const params before we get them, and could do so inconsistently!
